# üß† Brain Tumor MRI Classification using VGG19

A deep learning-based project for classifying brain tumors from MRI images using the VGG19 model, achieving over **98% accuracy**. This system supports real-time predictions through a Flask web interface and is designed to assist radiologists with faster and more reliable diagnostics.

## üîç Features
- Classifies MRI scans into 4 tumor types
- Preprocessing: resizing, normalization, denoising
- Fine-tuned VGG19 with dropout and class balancing
- Real-time web predictions via Flask
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, F1-Score, Recall

## üöÄ Getting Started
